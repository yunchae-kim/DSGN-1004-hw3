              You see a table with potions and a sheet of paper. It seems like a
              riddle. The paper reads: Danger lies before you, while safety lies
              behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One
              among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the
              drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
              Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. Choose, unless
              you wish to stay here for evermore, To help you in your choice, we
              give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries
              to hide You will always find some on nettle wineâ€™s left side;
              Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you
              would move onwards, neither is your friend; Third, as you see
              clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds
              death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on
              the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first
              sight.
